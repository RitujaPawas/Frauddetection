# Fraud Detection
### Detecting Frauds in Transactions using Anamoly Detection Techniques Such as Over Sampling and Under-Sampling as the ratio of Frauds is less than 0.00005 thus, simply applying Classification Algorithm may result in Overfitting.

##Classifier used is : XGBoost Classifier
##normalization technique: Standard scaler
##Sampling technique: SMOTEENN




##accuray obtained: 99.9%
